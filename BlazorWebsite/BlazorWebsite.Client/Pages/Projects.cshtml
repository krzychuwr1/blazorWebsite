    <h1>This website</h1>
    <p>It has been written using experimental framework blazor. It is still somewhat a work in progress (just like blazor). I created it because I've thought about creating a blog for a long time, and I really wanted to try blazor out on some real project.</p>

    <h1>Metin Go</h1>
    <p>Basically Pokemon Go but with more focus on combat and equipment system. I am creating this game as a university project, however I do plan on still developing it after the semester is over.</p>
    <p>The game is being written in Xamarin.Forms. Yes, I am aware that it is not exactly the best tool for creating games, but as the focus of the game is on combat and equipment it is not that bad.</p>
    <p>The game has not yet been published, however it should be available in play store somewhere around June 2018, and in future maybe also in App Store. The game also works on UWP but I doubt anybody will play it on PC or W10 mobile phone</p>
    <p>By the way, the name Metin Go is a temporary name, and assets are also just a placeholder.</p>

    <h1>UWP Speech recognition app on Windows 10 IoT on raspberry pi controlling the lights and sending data to cloud</h1>
    <p>
        This was actually a rather small project, but I decided to mention it cause it was a lot of fun. We created it for our IoT classes on university. Also it has a lot of buzzwords.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, I installed windows 10 IoT on Raspberry Pi, connected external sound card, then connected external microphone to the sound card.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I was able to use windows speech recognition API in UWP project, and control the lights based on sound command. I've also setup sending the information about registered words to IoT Event Hub on Azure.
